![panel](https://github.com/mese79/easy_lightmap/raw/master/shot1.png)

For baking your object light map to use in another engine like [three.js](http://threejs.org), first you have to add two uv layers and unwrap them. Then you must decide that do you want to bake diffuse color or object texture. if no then you have to un-check texture box and reset diffuse color into simple white color... . After baking was done you may want to revert your object material back to before baking state.

Well with this addon you can do all these steps just by one click!


###### Requirement: ######
I'm using ImageMagick *mogrify* command to remove diffuse color from baked image.
